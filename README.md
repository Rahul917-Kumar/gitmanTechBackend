# Description
In this project i worked on an API to get list of user from MONGODB which mathces the search query provided by the user.<br></br>
This API endpoint is designed to perform a user search in a MongoDB database based on a provided search query. It is built using Django REST Framework (DRF) and PyMongo. The main goal is to allow clients to search for users by their names in a flexible, case-insensitive mannerâ€”whether the search input is a partial first name, a full name (first and last), or just a surname.

### Details about the API?
Depending on the input:<br></br>

  <b>Single Token Input</b>:<br></br>
    If the search query consists of only one word (e.g., "am"), the API searches for any user whose first name or last name starts with that token. This is done using an OR condition in the database query.<br></br>
  <b>Multiple Token Input</b>:<br></br>
    If the search query contains multiple words (e.g., "Amit Sharma"), the API assumes that the first token corresponds to the first_name and the last token corresponds to the last_name. It then builds a query that requires both fields to start with the respective tokens, resulting in a more refined search.

<b>Input Processing</b>:<br></br>
    The API reads the search_query parameter from the GET request.
    It uses the Python strip() method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.
    If the resulting query is empty (i.e., the user only provided spaces), the API immediately responds with a 400 error.

<b>Tokenization and Query Building</b>:<br></br>
    The cleaned search query is split into tokens based on whitespace.<br></br>
    <b>For a single token</b>:<br></br>
    The API constructs a MongoDB query using the $or operator to match documents where either the first_name or last_name field begins with the token. Regular expressions ($regex) are used with the ^ anchor (to ensure the match starts at the beginning) and the "i" option for case-insensitivity.
    <br></br><b>For multiple tokens</b>:<br></br>
    The API assumes the first token represents the first_name and the last token represents the last_name. It then builds a query with both fields using regular expressions, resulting in a more specific search.

### Request body
```
{
    "search":"rahul"
}

```

### Examples

#### 1. If single token is provided
so it will search both first_name and last_name for a user and use or operator that either of the two condition should match
```
{
    "search":"am"
}
```

#### 2. If two token are provided
so the algorithm compares first token to first_name and second token to last_name and take and of it
